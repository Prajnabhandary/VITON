This project provides a virtual try-on experience by leveraging background removal and inpainting techniques. It uses the `rembg` library for background removal and the `diffusers` library for inpainting with Stable Diffusion. The application is built with Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use web interface.

### Brief about the Architecture

The architecture consists of an end-to-end pipeline for generating virtual try-on images. It starts with background removal using the `rembg` library and proceeds with inpainting using the `diffusers` library. The framework is designed to be adaptable for various image processing and manipulation use cases.

## Tools/Models Used

- **Background Removal:** `rembg` library
- **Inpainting:** `diffusers` library with Stable Diffusion model
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/virtual-try-on.git
    cd virtual-try-on
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary model for inpainting downloaded:

    ```python
    from diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting
    pipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from_pretrained(
        "runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16", safety_checker=None,
        requires_safety_checker=False
    ).to("cuda")
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload an image using the file uploader.

4. Click the "Generate" button to create the inpainted image.

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`
- `rembg`
- `Pillow`
- `torch`
- `diffusers`

Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible GPU and the necessary drivers installed for the best performance.
